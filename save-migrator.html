    <h1>Katakana War Save Migrator</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the Katakana War Save Migrator, a tool designed to
    facilitate transferring save files between the standalone
    application and an alternative web-based version of
    the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/554600/Learn_Japanese_To_Survive_Katakana_War/">“Learn Japanese To Survive! Katakana War”</a>
    game. This utility helps navigate around technical issues
    encountered in the standalone version by making use of the game’s
    inherent web compatibility.</p>

    <p><b>Important Disclaimer:</b> This utility operates
    independently and is not endorsed by Sleepy Duck or River Crow
    Studio, the game’s developers. For official game-related
    merchandise or to support the creators, please
    visit <a href="https://study-japanese.net/">study-japanese.net</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Background on Game Versions:</b> “Learn Japanese To Survive!
    Katakana War” is primarily a standalone game. Although it operates
    mainly as a desktop application, its architecture is based on web
    technologies, housing a “www” subdirectory that can function
    directly in web browsers. This setup isn’t a separate web version
    per se but rather the same application accessed through a browser
    via a local server. This method is not officially documented or
    supported but is entirely feasible. It does, however, manage its
    save games differently than the standalone mode.</p>

    <p><b>Why This Utility Exists:</b> Sometimes the standalone
    version of the game works great, but other times you might run
    into weird glitches or issues, especially if your system setup is
    a bit unusual. If you find the game runs smoother in your web
    browser, or if you just prefer playing there, this tool makes it
    easier to move your save files back and forth. It’s handy for
    keeping your game going, no matter where you choose to play.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Back Up Your Game Data:</b> Before proceeding, ensure you
        back up your game data to avoid any accidental
        loss. <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4593-5CB7-DC3C-64F0">Here’s
          how to back up your game.</a> This Save Migrator utility has not
        been extensively tested and could potentially affect your saves
        or the app itself.</li>

      <li><b>Prepare the Utility:</b> Download this utility and place
        the file in the app’s <code>www</code> directory. For example,
        the path might be <code>~/.steam/steamapps/common/Learn Japanese
          To Survive! Katakana War/www/save-migrator.html</code>.</li>

      <li><b>Set Up the Server:</b>
        <ol>
          <li>Open a terminal window.</li>
          <li>Change the directory to where you’ve placed the file, using <code>cd ~/.steam/steamapps/common/Learn Japanese To Survive! Katakana War/www</code></li>
          <li>Start a local server by running: <code>python3 -m http.server -b localhost</code></li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li><b>Access the Utility:</b> Open your web browser and go
        to <code><a href="http://localhost:8000/save-migrator.html">http://localhost:8000/save-migrator.html</a></code>
        to access the utility.  The game normally uses Chromium
        internally, so you may want to use Chrome.</li>

      <li><b>Perform the File Transfer:</b> Follow the detailed
        instructions in the sections below to transfer your save files
        between the standalone application and the web-based version,
        depending on your needs.</li>

      <li><b>Play the Game (Optional):</b> If you wish to play the
        game in the web browser, navigate
        to <a href="http://localhost:8000/">http://localhost:8000/</a>
        while the Python server is still running. Note: Modern browsers
        require a server to run such applications due to security
        restrictions.</li>

      <li><b>Finish Up:</b> Once you have completed transferring your
        saves and playing the game, you can terminate the
        server. Return to your command line and
        press <kbd>Control-C</kbd> to stop the Python server.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Copy local app to web app</h2>

    <p>This section explains how to transfer all your save files from
      the standalone application (the one you run from Steam) to the web
      version. Currently, it is not possible to transfer individual
      saves; this process will move all saves.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Check the Run Log:</b> Before you proceed, review the Run
        Log to see which saves are detected and will be
        transferred. If you have not used the web version yet, the Run
        Log may be empty, indicating there are no saves to
        overwrite.</li>
      <li><b>Initiate Transfer:</b> Click the “Run” button to start
        transferring your saves. This process will overwrite existing
        saves in the web app with those from your local application.</li>
      <li><b>Verify Transfer:</b> After the transfer completes, check
        the Run Log again to ensure there were no errors during the
        process. It’s normal for some save slots to be reported as not
        found if you haven’t used all available save slots in the
        game.</li>
    </ol>

    <button id="run" disabled>Run</button>
    <div style="border: 1px solid black">
      <h3>Run log:</h3>
      <pre id="log" ></pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Download web app files to the local app</h2>
    <p>This section guides you through downloading your save files
      from the web version and saving them locally, effectively
      overwriting your existing Steam saves.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Identify Files to Download:</b> Review the list of files
        displayed. These are your saves from the web app. If you haven’t
        played the web version, there may be no files listed.</li>

      <li><b>Download and Save Locally:</b> Click to download each
        file listed. Once downloaded, move them to your game’s save
        directory. For example, the path would
        be <code>~/.steam/steamapps/common/Learn Japanese To Survive!
          Katakana War/www/save/</code> by default. This action will
        overwrite any existing saves in this directory with the ones
        from the web app.</li>
